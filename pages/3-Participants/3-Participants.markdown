## PARTICIPANTS

Previous works shows age [26, 27], sex [25, 27], and ethnicity [28, 29] affect EDA signals. For instance, younger adults show
larger increases in their SCR amplitude in cases of increasing arousal [13]. Further, caffeine and drug consumption
by participants prior to the study must be checked and balanced between groups. In particular, Boucsein et al. [8]
suggest to exclude participants who take anticholinergic medicines from the analysis, because they interfere with
the main neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system, acetylcholine [19]. As
acetylcholine regulates the sweat glands that are mainly innervated by cholinergic fibre [23], allergy
    medication, cold medication, or antidepressants, potentially affect skin conductance.</p>
