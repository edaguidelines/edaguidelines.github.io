## INTRODUCTION
<br>
<p align="justify">
Our findings in a systematic review [24] on EDA publications in CHI, highlighted severe issues with how EDA data has been collected and analysed by the CHI community. In this
page, we propose a set of recommendations for improving practices for designing and conducting studies involving
the analysis of EDA data. Our recommendations focus on the issues of highest concern in previous EDA studies in CHI
and provide a template for reporting the results of future studies. These recommendations shall serve as a minimum
scientific quality assurance for research utilizing EDA. Though we developed these recommendations based on the
requirements of recent EDA studies published at CHI, we note that they might not be suitable for all cases, due to the
wide variety of types of papers involving EDA data. We structured these recommendations based on different stages of a study from design to analysis. </p>
