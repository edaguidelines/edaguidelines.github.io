### Dependent Variables
<br>
<p align="justify">
The choice of which parameters of the EDA signal to analyse should be informed by previous works on the correlation
between them and different psychological constructs. For example, the SCL and the NS.SCR frequency correlate with
arousal [8] and the SCR amplitude correlates with the intensity of a stimulus [17]. Further, if deciding to use phasic
parameters of EDA, researchers must decide on the interval between the presentation of two stimuliâ€”Inter Stimulus
Interval (ISI). Generally, ISI reported in previous works vary between 20-60s [12], but choosing shorter ISI (e.g., 2-3 sec)
is possible if using approaches based on mathematical models [8] such as mathematical deconvolution models [1, 6] for
    analysis.</p>
